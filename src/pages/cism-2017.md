On March 3, 2017, Vladimir Putin has congratulated our national team on winning III World Winter Military Games CISM 2017 In Sochi. We join President in his greetings and along with that we celebrate the success of mobile application CISM Sochi 2017 especially developed by Stars & Fishes team for this event. Within the project we created the newsfeed, the messenger and the interactive quest which function as a local social network for participants and spectators of the Games. Our App has already become the best ever created for CISM application in AppStore. While its design has been marked by experts as one of the best in sporting events category.
